GamingVIVE:

What was your motivation?
 - To show that I improved by using a previous idea  of having a gaming website that has a games, gamingsystem, genre, and categories. 
   Unlike in my previous project I'm using views instead of swagger and using joining tables. 
   By using joining tables I can a games to multiple games, gamingsystems, genres, and categories. 

Why did you build this project?
 - To allow users to buy and view games by gamingsystems, genres, and categories.

What did you learn?
 - I learned how to build indirect joining tables and how to display info using them. 
   I Learned how to do a GetByName and got a better understandance on how controllers and service work together. 

What makes your project stand out?
 - My project stands out due to the indirect joining tables and by having a user set up and a settings set up. 
   The user set up just diplays the information as the settings set up allows users to edit/create/delete.
